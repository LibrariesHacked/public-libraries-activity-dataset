A loan is the issue or renewal of a library book by a library member. Loans counts include issues by format by month. The formats are:

- Physical book
- Physical audiobook
- eBook
- eAudio

Loans are further split into adult, young children (under 12) and young peopleâ€™s (12-17) books. This is an age rating assessment of the content, regardless of who is borrowing the book. 'Adult' means not specifically designed for chidren rather than being restricted to adults only.

Ebooks and eAudio do not include eMagazines or eNewspapers.
