A loan is the issuing or renewing of a library book by a library member. Loans counts include issues by format by month. The formats are:

- Physical book
- Physical audiobook
- eBook
- eAudio

Loans are further split into adult (18+), young children (Under 12) and young peopleâ€™s (12-17) books. This is an age rating assessment of the content, regardless of who is borrowing the book.

Ebooks and eAudio do not include eMagazines or eNewspapers.
