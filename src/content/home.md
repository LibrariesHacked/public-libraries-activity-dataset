The Libraries activity dataset, [from Arts Council England](https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/supporting-arts-museums-and-libraries/supporting-libraries), _"captures activity within public libraries in England"_ and _"contains metrics such as the number of active users, the number of and attendance at events, and information on loans and PC use"_.

This site provides a visual interface to explore that data. Not all services reported data so this is not a complete view of all public libraries in England.
