The Arts Council [libraries activity dataset](https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/supporting-arts-museums-and-libraries/supporting-libraries) _"captures activity within public libraries in England"_ including _"the number of active users, the number of and attendance at events, and information on loans and PC use"_.

This site provides a visual interface to explore that data through charts, headline figures and small insights. Most, but not all, services reported data so this is not a complete view of all public libraries in England.
