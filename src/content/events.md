An event is any scheduled activity session run by the library service which people attend through booking a place, or by 'drop-in', and at least one person attends. The focus is on events that the library service is organising and running. These could be library generated or using external programming (e.g. Summer Reading Challenge). They donâ€™t need to be in the library building. They can be regular activities e.g. weekly, or they can be 'one off' activities.

Events are split into physical and digital.

Attendees data counts the people attending these events. This includes actual attendees rather than those booked onto the event.
