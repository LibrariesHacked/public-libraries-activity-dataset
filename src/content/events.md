An event is any scheduled activity session run by the library services which people attend through booking a place, or by 'drop-in', and at least one person attends. The focus is on events that the library service is organising and running. These could be either library generated or using external programming (e.g. Summer Reading Challenge). They donâ€™t need to be in the library building. They can be regular activities e.g. weekly, or they can be 'one off' activities.

Events are split into physical and digital events.

Attendees data counts people attending these events. This include actual attendees rather than the number of people booked onto the event.
