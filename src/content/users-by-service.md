The service comparison view shows total active users as a % of the resident population, for each service. This allows for easy comparison of active users across services relative to their population size. Active user percentages are generally between 5-20%.

This is a reasonable measure for the engagement of a service with its local population. However, it does not account for those who may use a service but do not live in the area, for example students or workers who commute into the area.

The clearest example of this is the City of London, which has a very small resident population, exceeded by its active users. Some other services seem to have very large (>100%) active user rates, which require more investigation. It could be that they are counting all registered users, rather than just active users, and they may not have sufficient archive policies to remove inactive users.
