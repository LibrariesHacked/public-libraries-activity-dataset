The service comparison view shows the total active users as a % of their resident population, for each service as a bar chart. Each bar represents a service. This allows for easy comparison of active users across services relative to their population size.

In general this is a reasonable measure for the engagement of a service with its local population. However, it does not account for those who may use a service but do not live in the area, for example students or workers who commute into the area. It also does not account for services which may have a significant number of users who are not residents, for example a service in a tourist area.

The most overt example of this is the City of London, which has a very small resident population, which is exceeded by its active users. Some other services seem to have very large (>100%) active user rates, which warrant more investigation. It could be that they are counting all registered users, rather than just active users.
