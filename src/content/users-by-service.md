The service comparison chart plots total active users as a % of the resident population, for each service. This allows for comparison of active users relative to population sizes. Active user percentages are generally between 5 and 20%.

This is a reasonable measure for the engagement of a service with its local population. However, it doesn't account for the fact that many use a service but do not live in the area, for example students or workers who commute into the area.

The clearest example of this is the City of London, which has a very small resident population, exceeded by its active users.
