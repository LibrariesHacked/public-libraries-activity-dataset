These charts separate loans data for each item format by age group, and plot the number of loans per month. The age groups are adult, young children (under 12), and young peopleâ€™s (12-17) books. This is an age rating of the content, regardless of who is borrowing the book. 'Adult' means not specifically designed for chidren rather than being restricted to adults only.
