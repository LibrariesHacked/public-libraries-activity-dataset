These charts separate loans into a graph for each item format: physical books, ebooks, physical audiobooks, and then eAudio books.  

Each then plots the count of loans grouped by each content age group per month. The age groups are adult, young children (under 12), and young peopleâ€™s (12-17) books. This is an age rating of the content, regardless of who is borrowing the book. 'Adult' means not specifically designed for chidren rather than being restricted to adults only.
