These charts separate loan counts for each item format by their content age group, and plot the number per month. The age groups are adult, young children (under 12), and young peopleâ€™s (12-17) books. This is an age rating of the content, regardless of who is borrowing the book. 'Adult' means not specifically designed for chidren rather than being restricted to adults only.
