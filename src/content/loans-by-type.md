These charts separate loans for each item format: physical books, ebooks, physical audiobooks, and eaudio books.  

Each graph plots the count of loans grouped by age group per month. The age groups are adult, young children (under 12), and young people’s (12-17) books. This is an age rating of the content, regardless of who is borrowing the book. 'Adult' means not specifically designed for chidren rather than being restricted to adults.
