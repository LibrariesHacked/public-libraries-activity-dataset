Active users are counts of library members who have borrowed at least one piece of physical or digital content in the financial year.

When aggregating or comparing active user counts it's worth noting that these will include double (or more) counting of users who have used multiple services. For example, if a user has borrowed books from two different library services they will be counted as an active user in both services. It's hard to say how significant this is but it will vary depending on the local context of the services involved.
