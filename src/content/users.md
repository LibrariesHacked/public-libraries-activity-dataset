Active users are library members who have borrowed at least one piece of physical or digital content in the financial year.

When aggregating active users across services, it's worth noting that this could double count users who have used multiple services. For example, if a user borrows books from two different library services they will be counted as an active user in both. It's hard to say how significant this is, but it will vary depending on the local context of the services involved.
