The active users map shows the concentration of active users as a percentage of the population. It does this using a choropleth map (shaded regions) to show the differences between the different geographic areas.

By default it shows the total users. You can change to the different age groups (under 12, 12-17, adult), and it will show the percentage of active users of that age group. Not all services report at this level of detail so this reduces the available data.
