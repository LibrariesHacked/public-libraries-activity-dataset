Active users are broken down into groups of under 12, 12-17, and adults (18+). Some services were unable to break down users by age group and only reported total user counts. Those users are included in an 'Unknown' group. This allows for them to be included in the total user counts.

'Non-user' counts are a calculation based upon the population of the service minus the active users. By default these counts are hidden on the chart, to avoid mistaking them for users. You can enable them by clicking on the 'Non-users' label in the chart legend.
