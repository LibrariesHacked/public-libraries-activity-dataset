Some services were not able to break down users by age group and only reported total user counts. Those users are included in an 'Unknown' group. This allows for them to be included in the total user counts.

'Non-user' counts are a calculation based upon the total population of the services being considered minus the active user counts. By default these counts are hidden on the chart, to avoid a confusing initial impression. You can enable them by clicking on the 'Non-users' label in the chart legend.
